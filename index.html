        Greek Yogurt is healthier than regular yogurt. <br />
        It's made with live active cultures and is an excellent source of
        calcium for healthy bones. <br /><br />
        It's high in protein and low in sugar, which makes it perfect for
        breakfast, lunch, or dinner! <br />
        Greek yogurt is made by straining out the whey from regular yogurt. This
        results in a thicker, creamier <br />
        product that's higher in protein and lower in sugar than regular yogurt.
        <br />
        Greek yogurt is also much more versatile than regular yogurt. It can be
        used in a variety of recipes, from breakfast dishes to desserts.
